# CRA AST Localize

This is a project where I attempt to see if the following would work:

- [x] Scaffold a normal CRA project
- [x] Add a post-build script which reads the AST of the emitted files
- [x] Use source maps to find code corresponding to user files and avoid code from dependencies
- [x] Use context heuristics to kick out invalid literals (identifiers, JSX/TSX, â€¦)
- [ ] Replace string literals with a call to a localizer function (like `localize('')`)
- [ ] Warn on localization keys which are not contained within the localization files
- [ ] Append the localizer function implementation and the localization resources
- [ ] Observe a localized application without the need to clutter the code with resource lookup

`npm build` or `npm run postbuild` with an existing `build` directory

## To-Do

### Add a non-CRA version hosted on GitHub Pages

With JS/TS source input on one side and compiled output on the other for a demo

### Find out why some of the tokens get marked as `FirstBinaryOperator`

Maybe the string literal is a part of an expression.

### Replace the hardcoded text replacement with a localizer function invocation

Add two modes to work in

One where the text gets replace with a localizer version and the localized
version with the hardcoded localized strings gets saved with a locale suffix.
This mode is useful for translating app to another locale statically without any
runtime localization support.

Another where the string literals get replaced with a call to a localizer
function so that at runtime, a locale can be selected and on next render, the
strings are pulled from the new locale.
